In particular for each neighborhood, calculate the rate of liquor licenses per capita (the number of licenses divided by the neighborhood’s population).  Show the top 20 neighborhoods with the highest rate of alcohol availability. Show the top 20 neighborhoods with the highest number of licenses.  Discuss whether or not these two top-20 lists differ and how.  Define neighborhood as a US Census Bureau’s tract (discussed below).  Present this as a notebook, complete with documentation and code. Use the notebook to communicate about the data, process, and results.\n","\n","***Part 0: Submission details***\n","\n","10/10 Submit your answer as a completed notebook by the deadline posted on Canvas.
